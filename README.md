# Introduction
This project is a HTML website focussed around a formal study of Islamic Science. This README file aims to explain the motivation behind the subject matter, depict plans and wireframes of the website and detail the process of development, highlighting any major design features or adherance to standards. There will also be a section on some user testing to ensure functionality of components.

## Motivation
Being a student of the Sacred Islamic Sciences, my interest in it's many fields is deeply rooted. The traditional format of study is a 6 year intense course, wherein a number of books are read in great depth throughout the years. On average 6 books are studied each year (and students are recommended to read commentaries on each of these books). The sciences include: Arabic Language, Literature, Grammar, Morphology, Syntax, Eloquence, Poetry, Prose, Jurisprudence, Inheritance Laws, Quranic Exegesis, Prophetic Traditions, Finance and even Home Economics.

I am approaching the end of my 5th year of study. Now preparing for the final year in which 6 books (each on average 5-6 volumes) are read, cover to cover, spanning thousands of pages. This is a unique form of study where the student is being taught every tradition from the teacher (Principal Lecturer) with an ininterupted chain from himself up to the very person who first narrated it some 1400 years ago.

This website aims to draw a little insight into the books which are studied and into the prominent personalities. It's future use could well be adapted to becomming the goto guide for those wishing to join the course, or have a interest in understanding the curriculum.
